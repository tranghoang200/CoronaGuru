# coronafighter
This is the first AI ChatBot about Corona Virus (COVID-19). 

We made it for everyone to have update about the situation of the Corona virus without taking much time to go through lots of website.
The website has two main features: ChatBot and Live Update.

For the ChatBot, people will chat with the CoronaGuru to get information about the Corona virus. It can be what the prevention is, what countries found new case, or how many people got infected, etc. It also shows the chat history of the dialog if people want to go back and see what they have chat. 
For the live update, people will be linked to Johns Hopkins CSSE website to see the live map update of the virus around the world.

Process
